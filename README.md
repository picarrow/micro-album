PROJECT: Albums

PHP is required to run this program.
Albums is a program designed to make viewing photo albums more convenient.
It uses file-based photo albums to remain fast, simple, and hassle free.
Create a folder called "albums" in the same directory as the code (likely the root of your web app).
Drag any folder containing images into the "albums" folder in order to create an album.
The album's name is the same as the folder that it corresponds to.
Albums support pngs, jpgs, and even gifs!
Please look at sample.png for more information.
